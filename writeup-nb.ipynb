Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. Describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale, because it might save some model weights three times, as working with only 1 channel requires less resources. However, a couple of quick runs on a random 10-15% of the training dataset showed that the colored (3-channel) images works better in terms of the validation accuracy. I suppose, the color information (red circles, blue circles, ... ) is really important for recognizing signs, which are poorly visible. In fact, any (human) driver is tested for a clear color vision in particular; so I believe the grayscaling is not an option here.\n",
    "\n",
    "I normalized the image data using subtraction and division to make any image fit into [-0.5..0.5] range. This is required for further processing with a neural network, as the network works poorly with values greater then [-1..1]. This is done with `normalize_pickle()` function in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To plot images, I use a helper script `plot_helper.py` (left from the previous lane detection project). For example, the function `to_image()` can convert a float or integer 2-D array to an OpenCV-compatible numpy array of uint8 in range [0..255]. It is very convenient for plotting normalized images or other arrays from various processing steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "I decided to generate additional data because I have nod found much images with a visual noise in the training dataset, and I suppose that the real pictures could be worse. So I have implemented several functions for augmentation: salt&pepper noise, bleach, zoom in and grayscaling. Below is shown the original validation image #1010 (left), a 3 types of color bleach in the top row, and other types of augmentation in the bottom row:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I used the LeNet network as a point to start. The first network I trained was the classical LeNet with 2 Convolution and 2 Dense layers (the last one had 43 outputs instead of 10, of course). \n",
    "However, the validation accuracy has never reached above 0.06. So I have run over the lectures again, and realized that the weight/bias initialization was wrong - just a random floating point numbers, but not the `truncated_normal()`. Making the proper intialization has immediately improved the accuracy. After some experiments, I managed to reach the validation accuracy about 0.94. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then I considered the LeNet was developed to work with a grayscale images, and I am using 3-channel, which obviously have more information embedded; and also the number of classes is 4 times more. So, I have added some filters to the first Conv layer (6 --> 8) and also added one more Dense layer. To prevent overfitting, I have used Dropout after each MaxPool layer (as I remember, I saw this approach the first time in some Keras manuals). After a couple experiments with learning rate, batch size and dropout rate, I understood that running the training on CPU does not work good for me, as it is quite slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have spent a lot of effort trying to set up GPU runtime using Tensorflow 1.13, 1.12 and 1.14, and various versions of CUDA and CuDNN libraries, however, without a success. Neither I wanted to run the experiments in the project environment, as it is not quite convenient for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I have swithced to using Tensorflow 2.3.1, and that required some changes to the code, however I tried to keep it as close to the original lectures as possible. Hope that wouldn't be a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "While training on GPU (I have NVidia MX250 with 384 CUDA cores laptop version), I had about 10 times performance boost. Still, most the experiments with the learning rate, batch size, dropout rate and additional layers I performed on a fraction of the augmented training dataset. It turned out I can use 1/20..1/8 of the whole augmented dataset to quickly check if any change to a hyperparameter improves the validation accuracy or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Totally I made about 50 experiments with various hyperparameters, some variations of the augmentation pipeline, and some architecture changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 0.985\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 0.977 \n",
    "* test set accuracy of 0.955\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen an iterative approach, because I wanted to achieve the best possible result.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?\n",
    "Initially, it was a regular LeNet architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "As the LeNet is intended to be used with grayscale image, and I understood that the color information for the road signs is valuable and should not be discarded, the issue was: how to make LeNet work with colored images. At first, I just added more channels to the input convolution layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? \n",
    "The resulting validation accuracy of the very first architecture was relatively low (<0.75), so I was adding Conv2D filters (e.g. increasing the output depth of a Conv layer), then adding more Conv2D-Maxpool chains. As I have bumped into overfitting (detected by having the training accuracy >0.9 and validation accuracy <0.7), I have added a Dropout layers, right after Pooling.\n",
    "I have also tried to vary Conv layers filter size (3x3, 7x7 and their combinations, e.g. different filter sizes in different layers), but the validation accuracy increase was either not reached, or just was not worth the performance drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "I have adjusted dropout layers quantity (1 .. 3) and the dropout rate (0,1 .. 0,5), convolution filter sizes (3x3, 5x5, 7x7) and convolution layers quantity (2 .. 3), maxpooling window size (2x2, 3x3).\n",
    "Also I have experimented with various augmentation techniques.\n",
    "To prevent overfitting and to automatize the training process, I have implemented an early stop algorithm, which took the best (maximum) validation accuracy, and if in next 5 epochs a better result was not reached, stopped the training. Using this approach, I had just set epoch counter to some large number, and let the TensorFlow to do the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "3 dropout layers with rate about 0.2 have helped a lot against overfitting (e.g. having a good accuracy on the training dataset but poor accuracy on the validation one).\n"
